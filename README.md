# Example-Apartment-Website

Welcome to my Example Apartment Website Design!

This is a base design and does have several placeholders for future content. In the main navigation bar, Applicant Login and Resident Login do not link to anything and would be connected to a login portal.

The Amenities, Floor Plans, and Photos tabs are serving as bones for what they could become. The layout is in place but there is lots of content that would be added in the future. "Amenities" will need a more extensive detail and layout to suit the apartment complex. "Floor plans" is intended to display back-end information that can show availability for each floor plan and be updated in real-time. "Photos" showcases the gallery design but would need more photos of the apartment complex.

Everything needed to run the website is included in this repository.

Thank you!
